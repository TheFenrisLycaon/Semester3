# List of Experiments ( Credits : 3 )

## Unit-1

- [ ] WAP in C++ to find the Kth largest element in an array using template and C++STL.

-  
  - [ ] A left rotation operation on a vector of size N shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left.
  - [ ] For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become[3,4,5,1,3].  
  - [ ] Given an vector of n integers and a number, d , perform d left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.  
  - [ ] Print a single line of n space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing d left rotations

- [ ] You are given a string containing characters A and B only. Your task is to change it into a string such that there are no matching adjacent characters.  
  - [ ] To do this, you are allowed to delete zero or more characters in the string.  
  - [ ] Your task is to find the minimum number of required deletions.  
  - [ ] For example, given the string s=AABAAB, remove an A at positions 0 and 3 to make s=ABAB in 2 deletions.

- [ ] Write a program to maintain a elementary database of employees using files.

## Unit-2

-
  - [ ] From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices using Dijkstra’s algorithm.  
  - [ ] Compute the transitive closure of a given directed graph using Warshall's algorithm.

- [ ] Obtain the Topological ordering of vertices in a given digraph.

- [ ] Implement N Queen's problem using Back Tracking.

- [ ] Implement Travelling Salesperson problem using Dynamic programming.

</br>  

## Unit-3

- [ ] Design a quick sort with random pivoting using Lomuto partition scheme.

- [ ] Demonstrate insert ,delete and search in Treap.
