# List of Experiments ( Credits : 3 )

- [ ] To study the architecture of PIC18

- To study and analysis the Instruction Set of PIC18.
  - [ ] Write a program to toggle the PORTB continuously forever and store - the contents in PORTB.
  - [ ] Write a program to get data from SFR of PORTB and send it to SFR of PORTC continuously.

- To examine and use MPLAB assembler and stimulator
  - [ ] Write an assembly program to add all the single digit of your UID - number and save the result in WREG register.
  - [ ] Then use MPLAB simulator to single step the program and examine the register

- To examine the flag bits of status register.
  - [ ] Write an assembly program to add the following data and use the simulator - to examine the various flags like carry, digital carry and zero flag after the execution of each addition. 99H , 01H , 66H - , 89H , 97H , 35H.
  - [ ] Write an assembly program to load the value into file registers from 20H to 24H location .Use the - complement command in each location and then use the simulator to examine the status of flag and file register content - after execution of each instruction.

- To examine the input and output bit manipulation program using MPLAB simulator.
  - [ ] Write an assembly program to toggle all - the bits of PORT B, PORT C, PORT D continuously by sending 55H and AAH to these ports. Put the time delay. Crystal - frequency is 4MHz. Then examine the ports step by step by using simulator
  - [ ] Write a program to get the byte of data from - PORTB and send it to PORTC, PORT D. Also give a copy of it to file register location 20H and 22H. Place a delay between - inputting from port and sending it out the ports. Then examine the ports and registers step by step by using simulator

-
  - [ ] To code the program for switching and Banks of program.
  - [ ] To code the program to transfer data from RAM space - to RAM location.
  - [ ] To code the program to transfer data from ROM space to RAM location.

-
  - [ ] To code the program to add hex numbers.
  - [ ] To code the program add BCD numbers.

- [ ] To interface a program the blinking of LED control with the help of switch.

-
  - [ ] To understand the operation modes of LCD
  - [ ] To interface and program LCD

- [ ] To interface a stepper motor to PIC microcontroller and control the Direction of stepper motor rotation.
