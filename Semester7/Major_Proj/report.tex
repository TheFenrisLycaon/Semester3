\setlength{\parskip}{0em}

In a world, ruled by knowledge and one that runs on information, it becomes crucial for a person to know what is happening around him. But with the abundance of knowledge and information it becomes difficult for a person to keep his own data bank up to date with all the facts flowing around him. \\

This is where my project comes in. Every piece of knowledge, every bit of information just one question away. Not only that, but it also helps you to keep your data bank up to date with the latest information. Sure you could just google stuff and get that required bit of data but google is big and the results are crowded. How do you fiter out the important parts of the information that is relevant to you ? How to you personalize it to the area or to the institution that you are in ? With my project, of course. Not only are the results about "your" institute, but it also comes with the relevance that you didn't know you needed. \\

The results are summarized, directly from your own instutute's webpages. The results are personalized to your needs. The results come in a conversational manner. It's like talking to the dean of the college but in a far more friendly and fun way. So now you won't have to go to the poorly designed college webpage. All you need to do is talk to this bot, like you would talk to one of your friends and all the information that you need is given to you. Instantly.\\

This project solves the problem of FOMO in an elegant way. Thereby, making the world, or at least your world, a better place.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

\subsection{Need Identification}

A number of students miss out on important information that is being circulated within an institution if they are not paying attention or miss out on classes.

\subsection{Problem Identification}

Missing out on this information causes a lot of issues for them such as missing:: \\
\vspace*{-3em}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Placement drives
    \item Events
    \item Tests
    \item Submissions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tasks Identification}

The major tasks include ::
\vspace*{-1.5em}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generating a data-bank using institute's site
    \item Generating a data-bank using institute's noticeboards
    \item Regularly updating the data-bank
    \item Providing a user-friendly way to convey this information to the relevant people.
    \item Providing a way to personalize the information to the user.
\end{itemize}
